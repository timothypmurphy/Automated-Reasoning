text {*
  First prove the following formula, which is valid in classical predicate
  logic, informally with pen and paper.  Use case distinctions and/or proof by
  contradiction.

  "If every poor man has a rich father,
   then there is a rich man who has a rich grandfather"
*}


text {*
Proof
(1) We first show: "\<exists>x. rich x".
Proof by contradiction.
    Assume "\<not> (\<exists>x. rich x)"
      Then "\<forall>x. \<not> rich x" 
      We consider an arbitrary "y" with "\<not> rich y"
      Then "rich (father y)"

(2) Now we show the theorem. 
Proof by cases.  
    Case 1:  "rich (father (father x))" 
             We are done.
    Case 2: "\<not> rich (father (father x))" 
            Then "rich (father (father (father x))) 
            Also "rich (father x)"
            because otherwise "rich (father (father x))"

  Now prove the formula in Isabelle using a sequence of rule applications (i.e.\
  only using the methods rule, erule and assumption).

text{* An alternative proof of the above that does not rely on meta variables and uses additional
       tactics/methods such as drule and cut_tac .Note the use of rule exCI too. 

       Note also that the order in which the subgoals are tackled are dictated by Isabelle but 
       there are ways of doing the proof in a way closer to the informal one e.g. using "prefer" 
       to change the order of the goals (although this makes the proof potentially more "brittle" 
       to changes in future versions of Isabelle *}
